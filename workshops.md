following morning (Wednesday 15th).

See the details below if you would like to register for any of the workshops.

<a name="3DGIS">3D GIS Workshop and Tutorial</a>
----------------------

For more information please [download the flyer](./figures/3DGIS.pdf).

### Introduction

No longer bound by traditional 2D physical representations, there a steady shift towards
three-dimensional data (3D) allowing for a less abstract version of the real world. The workshop
aims to provide an introduction to working with 3D GI data as well as raising awareness and
understanding of the capabilities of the third dimension. Attendees will gain experience working
with a variety of 3D packages and plugins including ArcScene, Google Earth, QGIS, Three.js and FME,
learning to handle, process and present data in 3D.

This workshop is being run by Dr Claire Ellul (UCL) and Kelvin Wong (UCL). Claire is a lecturer in
Geographic Information Science (GIS) in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic
Engineering and is the Director of MSc in GISci. Her research interest include 3D GIS, spatial
databases, big data performance optimization and approaches for handling large quantities of spatial
data. Kelvin is a 3D GIS researcher at the Department of Computer Science, and is currently working
in conjunction with Ordnance Survey in developing a new 3D dataset for Great Britain.

###The workshop will provide:

 - An overview of the state of the art in 3D GIS;
 - Experience with handling and processing 3D geographic information;
 - An insight into the future of 3D GIS;
 - A discussion on the challenges 3D GIS faces.
