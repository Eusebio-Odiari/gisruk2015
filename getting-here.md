The conference takes place from midday of Wednesday the 15th
until 1:30 pm on Friday 17th.

Leeds is a well-connected city, enabling you to travel here by many
modes, including train, coach and walking and cycling. Many of the options
are described on the
[University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/20014/about/157/how_to_find_us)
website. Below we build on some of these.

## Train

[Leeds train station](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/LDS/details.html)
 has fast links to the North and South. To book
a train heading to Leeds for 15/04/14,
[National Rail](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) is a good place to start.
If you would like to bring a bicycle on the train,
you can book reservations via
[East Coast](http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/on-board-our-trains/baggage-and-pets/cycles/).

## Coach

[National Express](http://www.nationalexpress.com/wherewego/townsandcities/coach-travel-to-leeds.aspx)
lists a number of routes from around the UK
going to and from Leeds. These are sometimes cheaper than travelling
by train so may be a good option for people travelling on a budget.

## Walking and cycling

Walking from the train station is pleasant, taking you through the
commercial centre of Leeds. It takes 25 minutes.

Cycling here is even quicker, taking under 10 minutes, although the
route is mostly uphill - see [CycleStreet.net](http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/41202073/)
for our recommended route.

For the adventurous, there is even potential to cycle from further afield.
With construction of the
[Leeds to Bradford cycle superhighway](http://www.cyclecityconnect.co.uk/participate.php),
cycling from the West has never been easier.

## Arrival at Leeds

Once you have arrived at the University of Leeds on Wednesday,
registration will be from 12 to 1:30 pm at the
[Parkinson Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson_Building).
This is the well-known front entrance of the university, just off Woodhouse
Lane.
